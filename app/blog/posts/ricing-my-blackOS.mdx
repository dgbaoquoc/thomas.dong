## Introduction

I absolutely adore using dark mode. The sleek and modern aesthetic it brings to my macOS setup is simply unmatched. Here's a rundown of the tools and customizations I've implemented to create my ideal "BlackOS" environment.

## My current laptop profile

I'm using Mac Air M1 16/256 Gray color. While I admire the allure of the Mac M3 Black Space color, it was a bit out of my budget range. Nevertheless, I've taken matters into my own hands and customized my macOS with a dark theme that rivals the sophistication of the elusive Black Space model.

## Raycast

[Raycast](https://raycast.com/) is my go-to productivity tool on macOS. With its powerful scripting capabilities and intuitive interface, I can streamline my workflow like never before. From quick file navigation to custom scripts for automating repetitive tasks, Raycast has become an indispensable part of my setup.

Some of my extensions include:

- [Arc](https://www.raycast.com/the-browser-company/arc) Arc extensions for Raycast
- [Code](https://www.raycast.com/thomas/visual-studio-code) for searching and opening files in Visual Studio Code
- [Emoji](https://www.raycast.com/FezVrasta/emoji) for quickly inserting emojis into text
- [Github](https://www.raycast.com/raycast/github) for managing GitHub repositories

## Arc Browser

[Arc Browser](https://arc.net) is my preferred file manager for macOS. Its minimalist design and customizable dark theme perfectly complement the overall aesthetic of my BlackOS setup. With Arc Browser, managing files and folders feels effortless and visually appealing.

## Editor

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my trusted code editor, and I've customized it to fit seamlessly into my BlackOS environment. Here are some of the key elements of my setup:

### Custom Theme

I've created a bespoke dark theme that enhances readability and reduces eye strain during long coding sessions. The combination of deep blacks and vibrant accents creates a visually stunning coding environment that inspires creativity and focus.

You can open the settings.json file with the Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON) command in the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).

### settings.json
